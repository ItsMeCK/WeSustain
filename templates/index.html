        <p> You can specify the tolerance if you wish to (from 0.0 to 1.0). By default is <b> 0.50 </b></p>
        <p> Tolerance is to measure how much distance between faces to consider it a match. Lower is more strict </p>

        <p><b> Note: </b> The API will return a sharpness_similarity, which ranged from <b>0.0 (very different) </b> to

        <p> * On the attribute that returned from API, only both <b> sharpness_similarity </b>
            and <b>confidence </b> must more than the threshold specified, then only the face matching is consider pass
